To enable quiz mode for a particular room, select the checkbox located below the room before clicking on the room.

## Instructions for Board Modification

### Modifying Quiz Mode Boards
Quiz Mode uses a different set of boards from Normal Mode, defined in switch_lvl_quiz(). Modifying the boards for Quiz Mode would not affect the boards for Normal Mode.

To modify a board for a specific level:
1. Find switch_lvl_quiz() in `turtles.html`
2. Find the level you want to change, e.g. case "1-1" for wall level 1
3. Modify the jCoord, wallCoord, iceCoord, crateCoord before the `break;` statement (Note: please leave `break;` intact)

In-line examples are given in `turtles.html`

## Delete Persistent
This feature was added along with the level-caching feature.
Deleting the cached records would not interfere with any data communication and collection involved.
Once four rooms have been populated with student records and students no longer need to access the game, you may want to clear the rooms so that a new teacher leading a new room of students could start fresh.

To remove the Delete Persistent button and its feature:
In turtles-teacher.html, find <!-- IMPORTANT delete the two lines below if you want to disable Delete Persistent --> and delete the two lines below.
